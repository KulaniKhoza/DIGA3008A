          <h3>URL Scheme and Folder structure</h3>
          <p>
            This week, we began a simple introduction in the HTML language and
            website development. We touched base on "What is a website" and
            "What are the components that create what we know as a website". A
            consistent word was repeatedly brought up this week that properly
            dissects the answers to these queries. The word was "Wireframe"
            which was explained as the outline and layout of the "Website" in
            which the difference between a website and web page was illustrated.
            In this, the purpose of HTML was brought to light as it was
            explained as the creation of structure of the website and not the
            styling. It was referred to as the bones (Human body) of the
            website. This alludes to how the use of HTML creates the main
            foundation of your website and how it initializes the various
            information from the folders created. This led to conversations
            about folders and how in industry projects are preferred to be laid
            out in a neat and orderly fashion. This was to be implemented in our
            own project folders, in which different designated information
            should be placed in their own folders underneath the project folder.
            In this, my folder structure was laid out in this specific format.
          </p>

          <ul class="BlogLists">
            <li>
              Blogs – Weekly blog posts, stored as index HTML files with names
              relative to the blog post
            </li>
            <li>Images – Where PNG files of our images will be saved</li>
            <li>Scripts – JavaScript code files</li>
            <li>Styling – CSS files for the aesthetic of the website</li>
            <li>
              index.html – Our home page with an introduction about who I am
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In terms of the URL scheme, I didn't do too much because lucky for
            us, GitHub handles the URL scheme and provides the necessary license
            we require. If we didn't have it, I would need a deeper dive in URL
            scheme as a concept to initialize the website as its own identity.
          </p>

          <h3>Website Inspirations</h3>
          <ul class="BlogLists">
            <li>WIX.com</li>
            <li>Unity</li>
            <li>store.steampowered.com</li>
            <li>Fifa.com</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The websites listed above are some of the websites that I have
            visited and used in the past. They are all very different in terms
            of their purpose and what they aim to achieve. But they all have one
            thing in common, which is that they all have a very clean and
            professional look to them. This is something that I would like to
            achieve with my own website. I want it to be simple and easy to
            navigate, while still looking good. I also want it to be responsive,
            so that it looks good on all devices.
          </p>

            'You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media
            (1991)' - Moulthrop, S.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The essay created by Moulthrop entails the creation of the Xanadu by
            Ted Nelson as a linkage and read-only system. He frames it as a
            digital equivalent of a library but on a global and interlinked
            stage. He continues to reference Bush and his ideals and vision of
            memex to further elaborate the creation of the web and traces the
            very steps that led to its invention. He does this to elaborate the
            historical information of hypertext and growth of interactivity in
            general. He further extends on the impact of hypertext in context of
            "Laws of Media" by McLuhan, which questions:
          </p>

          <ul class="BlogLists">
            <li>Its ability to enhance</li>
            <li>What does it render obsolete</li>
            <li>What does it revive/retrieve that was previously obsolete</li>
            <li>What happens when it is taken to its limits</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            With context to these questions, Moulthrop's essay elaborates that
            hypertext creates and alludes to an interconnected network similar
            to fast food chains in which retrieving and linking information
            occurs in an improved way. A way in which readers may connect
            different ideas to different texts and information and overall be on
            a larger platform for interactivity. He also mentions how the effect
            of hypertext may create a downfall for print culture which may be
            referred to as "the death of the book". In this way, this alludes to
            a change in the traditional way of interacting with media, creating
            a new one with passive media mixed with active engagement. He then
            further extends his points by mentioning that hypertext brings back
            older means of information engagement. He emphasizes that the
            knowledge may be passed on the premise of linked and associative
            text and commentary provided by user inputs, hence connectivity
            through ideas evolves. He also further extends on the consequences
            and the need for control in this future venture. Although Moulthrop
            wrote this during the early development of the web, his concerns are
            still highly relevant. His warning that hypertext might be taken
            over by corporations has become a reality, as seen in the dominance
            of tech giants like Google and Facebook. However, the growth of
            open-access platforms shows the democratic element he imagined,
            showing that hypertext can still serve for broader access to
            information.
