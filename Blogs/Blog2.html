          <h2>URL Scheme and Folder structure</h2>
          <p>
            This week, we began a simple introduction in the Html language and
            website development. We touched base on "What is a website" and
            "What are the components that create what we know as a website". A
            consistent word was repeatedly brought up this week that properly
            dissects the answers to these queries. The word was "Wireframe"
            which was explained as the outline and layout of the "Website" in
            which the difference between a website and web page was illustrated.
            In this,the purpose of HTML was brought to light as it was explained
            as the creation of structure of the website and not the styling. it
            was referred to as the bones( Human body) of the website. This is
            alluded to how the use of html creates the main foundation of your
            website and how it initializes the various information from the
            folders created. This led to conversations about folders and how in
            industry projects are preferred to be laid out in a neat and orderly
            fashion. This was to implemented in our own project folders, in
            which different designated information should be placed in their own
            folders underneath the project folder. In this, my folder structure
            was laid out in this specific format.
            <ul>
                <li>Blogs - in which our weekly
                    blog post would fall under, stored as index html files with names
                    relative to the different blog posts </li> 
                    <li> Images - This is where the PNG
                        files of our images will be saved.  </li> 
                <li>Scripts - The specific scripts
                    that specifies our javascript code.</li>  
                    <li>Styling - this is where my
                        specific CSS code will be saved for the purpose of making our
                        website aesthetically pleasing</li>
                <li>index Html - this is described as our
                    home page in which an introduction of who i am will be written</li>
            </ul>
            In
            terms of the URL scheme, i didnt do too much of it because lucky for
            us Github handles the URL scheme and also gives the necessary
            license that we require.If we didnt have it, i would need a deeper
            dive in URL scheme as a concept in order to initialize the website
            as its own identity.

          <h4>
            You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media
            (1991)' - Moulthrop, S.
          </h4>
          <p>
            The essay created by Moulthrop entails the creation of the Xanadu by
            Ted Nelson as a linkage and read only system. He frames as a digital
            equivalent of a library but on a global and interlinked stage. He
            continues to reference Bush and his ideals and vision of memex to
            further elaborate the creation of the web and traces the very steps
            that led to its invention. He does this elaborate the historical
            information of hypertext and growth interactivity in general. He
            further extends on the impact of hypertext in context of "Laws of
            media " by McLuhan, which questions its :  
            <ul>
                <li> its ability to enhance</li> 
                <li> what does it render obsolete</li>
                <li>What does it revive/retrieve that was
                    previously obsolete</li> 
                 <li>What happens when its taken to its limits</li>
            </ul>
             With
            context to these questions, Moulthrop essay elaborates that
            Hypertext creates and alludes an interconnected network similar to
            fast food chains in which retrieving and linking information occurs
            in an improved way. A way in which readers may connect different
            ideas to different texts and information and overall be in a larger
            platform for interactivity. Therefore answering the order of
            enhancement. He also mentions how the effect of hypertext may create
            a downfall for print culture which may can also be referred to as
            "the death of the book" in this way, this alludes a change of the
            traditional way of interacting with media in creating a new one with
            passive media mixed with active engagement. He then further extends
            his points by mentioning that Hypertext brings back older means of
            information engagement, he emphasizes that the knowledge may be
            passed on the premise of linked and associative text and commentary
            provided by user inputs hence connectivity through ideas evolves.He
            also further extends on the consequences and the need of control on
            this future venture. But i was very confused on how to further
            elaborate on his opinion here (Sorry Not Sorry). Although Moulthrop
            wrote this during the early development of the web, his concerns are
            still highly relevant. His warning that hypertext might be taken
            over by corporations has become a reality, as seen in the dominance
            of tech giants like Google and Facebook. However, the growth of
            open-access platforms shows the democratic element he imagined,
            showing that hypertext can still serve for broader access to
            information.
