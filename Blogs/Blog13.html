        <h3>The Internet as a moral space</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            When I consider what an ethical internet looks like to me, I compare
            it to my previous view on ethics in general, alluding as a matter of
            simply enforcing rules,restricting harmful content(protecting users)
            and adjusting technical/cookie settings. Rather, I have come to
            understand the internet as a moral environment,a space that carries
            with it the weight of ethical responsibility. Inspired by the work
            of media theorist Roger Silverstone and the reflections of Shani
            Orgad in “The Internet as a Moral Space”, I now view the internet
            not just as a tool for interaction, but as a place where decisions
            about what people can see, who can use a site, and how they can
            interact with it affect the lives of others. We as people never know
            the reach we have on various audiences hence a need of caution is
            required.
          </p>

          <p>
            My own development as a Web developer has derived a familiar path. I
            began by focusing on structure, user experience, and functionality.
            I wanted my website to run efficiently, look clean, and be easy to
            navigate. Initially, it was built as a series of HTML pages, but as
            I introduced CSS and JavaScript to manage dynamic content such as an
            automatic navigation bar and interactive blog listings,I realized
            that my design decisions were also social and ethical ones. Each
            time I made the interface more responsive or the navigation more
            intuitive, I was doing more than improving usability. I was shaping
            how others experienced the space/my website, and by extension, how
            they felt seen by my design, how they felt included and or
            excluded.Essentially i was navigating their interactivity and user
            experience to what i would derive as a “ethical internet” Shaping
            their emotions in either a positive or negative way.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reading Silverstone’s work added a deeper layer to this my thinking
            and definition to an ethical internet. He argued that the media of
            which the internet is now an inseparable part constitute a moral
            space, one where the quality of our relationships with others,
            particularly distant relations(people we relatively don't know), is
            continuously negotiated. One of his most interesting contributions
            is the concept of “proper distance,” the idea that ethical
            relationships require a balance in a sense that it is close enough
            to acknowledge and care for the other, yet distant enough to respect
            their difference. In digital spaces, where proximity is easily faked
            and connection can be superficial and unreal, this idea challenges
            the dominant view that more interaction automatically means deeper
            engagement making us question it ethically as a whole.
          </p>

          <p>
            Silverstone criticises the kind of connectivity and concept of
            relationship the internet often promotes,he emphasises on the manner
            social networks and algorithms bring people closer and make
            differences less visible, but this doesn't always encourage people
            to act responsibly. As Shani Orgad explains in her interpretation of
            his work,explaining that the problem isn’t how far apart people are
            online, but that we often don’t feel responsible for others we
            interact with from a distance. This feels especially true today,
            where being “connected” doesn’t always mean we understand, care
            about, or respect each other hence bringing back the fact that
            interactivity feels superficial and fake in relation to the
            internet. In fact, the architecture of many online platforms seems
            to encourage superficial engagement for example: likes, shares, and
            fleeting reactions rather than meaningful understanding or
            obligation and responsibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            This insight changed how I thought about even basic features on my
            site.I began to question whether this type of engagement truly
            invited users to reflect or care about the content. True
            responsibility, as Silverstone emphasized, It’s not just about
            give-and-take or numbers. True responsibility means caring no matter
            what, even if nothing comes back in return.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another important idea from Silverstone’s work is the need for
            hospitality. Online, this means making room for people who may not
            reply, agree with us, or fit in with the mainstream. An ethical
            internet isn’t based on the idea of “I’ll listen to you because you
            listened to me.” Instead, it’s about choosing to recognize and
            include others no matter how they respond. This is especially
            important when we design for accessibility and inclusion. We need to
            make sure people who are often left out because of disability,
            language, internet access, or social barriers can not only use
            digital spaces but also feel truly welcomed in them.
          </p>

          <p>
            So what does an ethical internet look like to me today? It is a
            space that is inclusive by design, where difference is not only
            tolerated but welcomed. It is an environment where users are
            encouraged to slow down, reflect, and engage thoughtfully, rather
            than being swept up in automated feeds or manipulative design
            patterns. It is built on transparency, where both users and platform
            owners are accountable for the structures they create and sustain.
            Most importantly, it is a space where care is built into the very
            architecture where hospitality, not just connection, is the guiding
            principle.
