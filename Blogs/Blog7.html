          <li>
            The website is simple and minimalistic, offering a user-friendly
            interface that ensures easy navigation for all customers. Its clean
            and professional design avoids overstimulation, making it ideal for
            banking and financial platforms where professionalism is the top
            priority.
          </li>
          <li>
            The color palette and scheme remains consistent throughout the
            website with the colours of the Capitec emblem serving its
            foundation and structure , reinforcing the company's brand identity.
            This strategic use of color ensures that the combination becomes
            strongly associated with Capitec, much like how customers instantly
            recognize yellow and red as representing McDonald's.
          </li>
          <li>
            The text is very readable, with a well-structured hierarchy
            maintained throughout the website. The contrasting white background
            enhances the clarity of the text, making both the font and colors
            stand out for easy readability. Titles are emphasized with bold,
            large fonts, while paragraphs feature dark, legible text, ensuring
            an easy reading experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            The site is not content-heavy, presenting only essential information
            on key topics. This ensures that users are not overwhelmed with
            excessive content, making it user-friendly.

          <ul class="BlogLists">
            <li>
              Although the navigation bar is straightforward, providing clear
              sections and headings for users to access banking information, it
              leads to different webpages that each have their own navigation
              bars. This inconsistency can be confusing. Additionally, the menu
              button feels somewhat hidden and may not be necessary. Instead,
              displaying the full navigation bar just like the main one would
              make all available sections and forums immediately visible hence
              improving accessibility.

              links provide other options underneath to different webpages
              of/different parts of the website. this can be overwhelming for
              the user , as he/she are exposed to a plethora of options to
              choose from.
