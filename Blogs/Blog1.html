          <h2>Jumping into the new year</h2>

          <p>
            As the first week of the new school year comes to a close, I find
            myself feeling both anxious and excited. The past week’s lectures
            have sparked engaging discussions, particularly about the evolution
            of the internet—how it continues to change, sometimes for the better
            and sometimes for the worse. One recurring topic was the impact of
            generative AI on our industry. There was a strong debate about
            whether AI could replace human skill sets, potentially reducing the
            need for workers in the coming years. However, it was also noted
            that AI lacks the ability to critically think and create art that
            resonates emotionally with people. This disparity presents an
            opportunity for us, the new generation, to bridge the gap by
            combining technical expertise with human creativity. Reflecting on
            what I hope to gain from this course, I realize that my engineering
            background has shaped the way I think—requiring precision,
            directness, and a structured approach to presenting information.
            However, this course challenges me to take a more reflective and
            expressive approach, one that aligns more with a writer’s
            perspective. My goal is to develop a well-balanced set of critical
            thinking skills that merge the logical mindset of an engineer with
            the creativity of an artist. With that being said, much of the work
            in this course also delves into the technical aspects of website
            creation. This includes an in-depth exploration of both front-end
            and back-end development, allowing us to refine our coding skills
            and take them to the next level. Additionally, this presents an
            opportunity to build a digital portfolio—something that could serve
            as a valuable reference for future job opportunities. Which serves
            my main purpose for this year as a whole. Which would be, being
            ready for the workspace after my degree.

          <h3>Git and Github</h3>

          My experience with Git hub was a fairly good one but i wouldn't say it
          was a smooth one. When setting up my github on Visual studio code, i
          was made aware that my git hub wasn't not fused with Git and therefore
          it wouldn't be displayed on my source control on my visual studio
          code. Once i was made aware of this, i played around with git and
          github and was able to fix this complication and in turn it created a
          learning experience for me on the depths of github and how it operates
          which improved my overall understanding of it. Everything else was
          pretty straight forward especially since we had a step by step guide
          provided to us on Ulwazi. Not to mention we had previous experience
          from our previous game design projects throughout our second year.

          <h4>Reading</h4>
          <p>
            "As we may think"at 65 "As We May Think at 65" is an extension of
            Vannevar Bush’s visionary 1945 paper, As We May Think. It reflects
            on Bush’s legacy, emphasizing how his groundbreaking innovations and
            revolutionary ideals continue to resonate in the modern era. From my
            understanding of both papers, Harper provides a perspective that
            praises Bush for developing analog-based concepts that laid the
            foundation for today’s web. Harper specifically highlights Bush’s
            emphasis on "association"—the idea that information should be
            organized through interconnected links rather than rigid
            hierarchical structures like alphabetical order or digital
            algorithms. Bush’s vision was not necessarily about creating a
            digital system but rather an analog construct where information
            could be dynamically linked, allowing knowledge to build upon
            itself. His goal was to design a system that enhances human
            cognition and facilitates learning through interconnected knowledge.
            Harper extends Bush’s vision by advocating for the development of
            systems that mimic the associative pathways of the human mind. By
            doing so, he argues, we can better manage vast amounts of
            information and ultimately foster higher levels of human
            intelligence and relinquish false information which in turn
            ultimately fits perfectly with todays society.
