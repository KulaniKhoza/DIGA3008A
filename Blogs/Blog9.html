          <h3>Kasapis Evaluation</h3>
          <p>
            Kasapis’s article is a call to action for governments, institutions,
            and people to rethink how we view internet access. He says it should
            be seen as a basic human right, not just something extra or a
            luxury. Access to the internet is important because it affects
            people’s dignity and their ability to participate in many parts of
            modern life.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the Covid-19 pandemic, many schools and workplaces closed to
            prevent the virus from spreading. People had to work, learn, and
            socialize from home using the internet. This made it clear that
            those without internet access faced serious problems. They were left
            out of important activities, which made their lives harder.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kasapis points out that not having internet access puts people at a
            big disadvantage. This is not just a problem for individuals, but
            for society as a whole. When many people cannot connect online, the
            gap between rich and poor grows larger. This digital divide means
            some people cannot take part in education, work, healthcare, and
            other essential services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kasapis also explains that as society becomes more digital, it is
            very important to make sure everyone has fair access to the
            internet. This helps promote social justice, allows people to join
            the economy, and supports personal and community development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, Kasapis argues that internet access should be treated like
            other basic human rights because it helps improve society overall.
            If we ignore this right, more people will be excluded and society
            will suffer. But if we ensure fair and free internet access for all,
            we can help create a more equal and connected world.
          </p>
          <h3>Tataki and Glynos(2020) - Digital Divide Widens</h3>

          <p>
            “Digital Divide Widens” by Tataki and Glynos brought to light the
            profound and persistent inequalities embedded in our digital
            world,inequalities that the COVID-19 pandemic brought to our
            reality. The reality of covid brought extensified the fact that not
            everyone has access to interact with digital world, while many of us
            had the privilege of entering the schooling and working sector
            through zoom meetings and so on,A large reflection of people and
            students did not have access to any type of online which lingers a
            sense unfairness and disparity for the future of education and and
            the future of the youth as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            The article made me reflect on the privileges often taken for
            granted such as having a computer, stable Internet, and a quiet
            space to work or study. It also highlighted how digital access is
            not a luxury but a fundamental need similar to Kasapis viewings ,
            especially in times of crisis. The authors’ point that digital
            infrastructure must be treated as essential public infrastructure,
            like electricity or water, resonated deeply with me. It’s not just
            about helping people catch up during a pandemic; it’s about ensuring
            everyone can participate in a rapidly digitizing world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I particularly found sections discussing how the digital divide
            disproportionately affects girls, low-income families, and those in
            the Global South interesting and disheartening. These insights
            emphasized how digital exclusion intersects with broader social
            injustices, reinforcing patterns of inequality. The temporary
            measures some governments implemented stemming from handing out
            laptops or free data felt like ploys to show people that “doing”
            something.They display lack of responsibility to acknowledge the
            depth of the situation as well as its severity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, this article made me think critically about the role of
            policy, technology, and collective responsibility in shaping a
            fairer digital future. If we fail to act now, we risk creating a
            world where access to opportunity is determined not just by
            socioeconomic background, but by digital connectivity. The authors’
            call to treat digital inclusion as a long-term priority, beyond the
            pandemic,is an urgent call to justice. This has made me aware of the
            situation arising in our global economy.
