          <p>
            When thinking about how my code matters in the context of
            decolonialism, I’ve begun to realize that even technical practices
            like web development are not neutral the software space in general
            arent neutral and follow a certain bias ,they reflect assumptions,
            values, and worldviews created by people above in positions of
            "power". In my own coding practice, I’ve noticed that I often use to
            Western frameworks, libraries, or templates without questioning
            whether they serve the cultural context im in and I’m designing
            for.This including the african space in terms geographical
            colonialism. Moving forward, I want to be more intentional about
            whose voices are centered in the user experience, whose aesthetics
            are reflected, and whether my code supports accessibility and
            accommodates diverse users,particularly those marginalized by Big
            tech companies. I wish not only my code but my content to challenge
            the dominant tech narratives and offer different perspectives that
            open conversations that change users opinions allowing curiosity to
            breed in.

          <h3>Incorporating JavaScript</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of development,Unfortunately most of my development was
            more based on practice work,ensuring i understand its purpose and
            how to implementing JavaScript into my website. With this, it was a
            very much necessary shift to explore javascript as it transposes a
            website from a static layout to a more dynamic and interactive one.
            To do this, I had to restructure parts of my HTML and CSS to work
            more modularly with the DOM. which kind of made wish to implement
            Html with the javascript in my mind ensuring for easier
            implementation and better semantic mark-up.This journey of learning
            javascript was more confusing and difficult than i realised but it
            made sense in the fact it would make my website alot more smoother
            and structured unlike relying solely on Css , as JS provides a more
            functionality then Css.
          </p>

          <p>
            my website is made up of basic HTML pages in which even the blog
            section has individual html pages. It worked, but every time a user
            clicked a link, the whole page had to reload. To improve this, I
            added JavaScript. This allowed me to control which content shows up
            without needing to reload the page. One big challenge was creating
            the navigation menu with JavaScript, using an array. which was
            intended to make it easier to update and keep everything consistent,
            while also giving users a smoother, faster experience but this is
            still in progress and is requiring a lot of effort and i also wanted
            it to inform the user the page their are on but like i mentioned
            before its still in progress.
          </p>
          <h3>Future Plans:</h3>
          <p>
            I plan to add event listeners to buttons to trigger specific actions
            and page changes especially in the blog section. Currently, the
            "next blog" buttons use regular links, which aren't as smooth or
            responsive as I’d like. Using JavaScript event listeners will allow
            for a more seamless and interactive experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            I plan to use JavaScript to add more interactive elements such as
            hover effects on menu items and interactive clickable images in the
            portfolio section. These features will make the user interface more
            engaging and responsive by providing immediate feedback based on
            user actions, improving the overall experience.
