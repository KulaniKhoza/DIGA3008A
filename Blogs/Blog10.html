        <article>
          <p>
            When beginning my close reading article, a recurring question of
            what an "Close reading"is supposed to look like and what it actually
            is, caused a large amount of confusion. For me to actually begin
            analysing required extensive amounts of reading of the actually text
            but still nothing.With all hope lost a found a , Following a
            definition by BCC, Close reading is a way of analyzing literature
            that pays close attention to the details within a passage or text.
            By examining these elements carefully, the reader uncovers deeper
            meanings. The insights gained from this process reflect the reader’s
            own understanding or interpretation of the text. [2] with this
            definition it led me to think to maybe structurelize it and format
            it into a manner of my understanding which led to think maybe i need
            to reference/grab certain pieces of text and place them as quotes
            and extensively write on each quote, with context that relates to
            the text , choose quotes that i deem interesting and reflective on
            the topic at hand. This may not be at all correct but according to
            the derivations of close reading ..creativity,interpretation and
            exploration don't follow "correct method" but is open to any idea of
            the writer allowing free analysis of text and his/she's own
            interpretation.

          <h3>Kasapis - 2020 - Internet Access is a Fundamental Right</h3>

          <blockquote>
            "happiness is a human right. Lack of food, education, health care
            and fair working conditions are obstacles to achieving happiness.
            Therefore, all of the above are - like happiness human rights." [1]
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            "free internet access should be indispensable to all members of an
            organized society." [1]
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            In this discussion , it begins with Rezis Debre, Chilean president
            Salvador Allende cited for his belief that "happiness is a human
            right" in the article's first paragraph of text.He opens by defining
            what a right is and what a right entails preparing a trailway to add
            his own opinion and requirement of what a right should be.He argues
            that essential needs such as food, education, healthcare, and fair
            working conditions are requirements for achieving happiness and any
            type of fulfillment . Therefore he argues these basic needs could be
            considered as human rights as well constituting it from the fact
            that happiness is a right. Kasapis attempts to create a comparative
            analysis between basic necessities and access to the internet,
            suggesting that basic essentials are required for a dignified and
            fulfilled life, so is access to the internet in the digital world.
            Hence reinforcing his point that free internet should be available
            everywhere and to everyone. Which then raises the question, why is
            not taken seriously as it is, why is not considered a right
            officially, what are the constraints stopping this ideal from
            advancing.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            “So those who do not have access to the internet cannot participate
            in this new kind of digital economy that is flourishing. This means
            that not only can they not buy or sell goods, but that they cannot
            "sell" their work;”[1]
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This discussion continues further in which the debate about treating
            internet access as a human right brings about explanations and
            reasons to treat it as such.It is argued that internet access plays
            a role in enabling individuals to exercise the basic fundamental
            rights, as it serves as a gateway to essential services and economic
            opportunities.The author elaborates and expresses a rise in digital
            inequality which inversely cause an increase in economic inequality.
            He highlights a comparative analysis between the immense online
            wealth amassed by certain individuals and alludes to the fact that
            most of the global population lacks internet access hence are unable
            to participate in possibly acquiring mass wealth. This is referred
            to as digital exclusion which prevents millions from participating
            in a new modern society, restricting them from services and
            opportunities in education, healthcare, and employment. Raising the
            question, how do we come up with solutions to this type of
            dilemma.The need of internet access becomes more and more potent.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            “Should all citizens have access to the internet - regardless of
            income - and if so, are governments supposed to take care of it?”
            [1]
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            “What should be the rules governing the internet and who will set
            them?” [1]
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            He ends his argument with questions that help us reflect on deeper
            concerns about equity, participation, and governance in the digital
            era. The author elaborates that the mission of the institute is to
            help answer these questions by promoting a fair and democratic
            digital society, one that is built on principles of a new defined
            human rights system. Taking internet access as any social or
            political benefit. It should be something everyone serves as a
            contributor but also listener and engager instead of solely relying
            on governance as its control factor, hopefully creating a future far
            from disparity.
