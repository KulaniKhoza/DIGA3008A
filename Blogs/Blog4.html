          <h2>IxD process</h2>

          <p>
            Interaction Design also known as IxD refers to or centers on the
            overall design process on how a user interacts with a digital system
            by creating a clear way to represent its information, actions, and
            visuals. I wish to implement these same principles in my website.
            the design process below provides a clear way to do this step by
            step. Its design process goes as follows:

          <h2>1. Goal Alignment</h2>

          <p>
            My goal for this project is to create a portfolio website that I can
            use to apply for future jobs and showcase my vast skill set and
            coding capabilities. I want to be able to update and improve this
            website whenever I please, ensuring it remains relevant for future
            employers. I also want users to gain a deep understanding of who I
            am, making me a desirable candidate to hire.

          <p>
            For my user flow, I want to create an application that is easy and
            simple to navigate. Users should find clear instructions and bold,
            readable text that guides them to the specific section of the
            website they wish to visit. Additionally, visuals and imagery will
            provide a brief summary of each section, reinforcing the key points
            of any text it goes with.

          <h2>Implementation</h2>
          <p>
            With my lack of experience in CSS and javascript, i cant quite begin
            with creating the implementation part but we can build a good
            foundation from our html website. I can create
            references/tags/attributes in my html code to help create a smooth
            transition for when css and javascript are added in.

          <h2>Website progress</h2>
          <p>
            Ive currently been enjoying learning html, i think ive acquired the
            fundamnetal requirements to create a basic outline of a website. In
            terms of my website, my blogs have been posted and are up in such a
            way that each blog has its own html script for a nice formatted
            look. I will be adding microformats and attributes to create easier
            reference for my CSS and JavaScript code. i have implemented all the
            basics from the tut videos but still need to add finishing touches
            on my homepage by going in depth about myself and creating a good
            profile page.
