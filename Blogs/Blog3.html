          <h3>Lecture this week</h3>
          <p>
            This week's lecture touched base on the interactivity and interface
            design. It further extends on the definition of these two elements
            from the previous week. We spoke of the definition of interaction,
            which is defined as a meeting point of an active body (usually a
            user) and the variable it can affect. It came to be that an
            interface would be a symbolic representation of the meeting point
            described in the previous definition. "Interaction" was further
            explained and elaborated to have responsiveness that was non-random
            and effectively caused a change in a system internally. The concept
            as a whole requires these key components: the user, the system
            itself, the element being manipulated, the action itself, and the
            visual representation of the change the user caused. These combined
            perfectly elaborate the key elements looked for in interaction as a
            concept. But for it to be meaningful, a visual representation is
            required in which an "interface" would serve as the bridge for this
            interaction. In turn, this makes us think about how we want our
            website to look and how we want the user to interact with the
            interface and website we intend to create. This creates questions
            like: "What is our target audience?", "What are our goals?", "How do
            we plan on mapping out our website or its structure?" and so forth.

            <strong>My Website Goals and Alignment</strong>: For my website, I
            wish to create a simple, free-flowing experience that is easy to
            navigate. I want to create pages that are direct and concise so any
            user can follow them. Being an engineering student, a main component
            I've learned is being direct and to the point. With this, I want to
            reflect the same clarity in my website. Although I've been trained
            as an engineer, I also aspire to explore my artistic side. Exploring
            CSS and JavaScript to enhance my website’s visual appeal—while using
            an engineering mindset—allows me to blend both worlds. I want my
            website to embody who I am and clearly showcase the work I’ve done.
            It should reflect the standard of an employed web developer. The
            main goal is to display my coding and front-end development skills.
            My website is mostly targeted toward employers and professionals in
            the field. It will serve as a portfolio that highlights my academic
            work in game design, web development, and electronics—truly
            representing my potential in the workspace. I aim to create
            intuitive navigation and a user-friendly interface.

          <h3>My Website Progress</h3>
          <p>
            So far, so good. That's what I can say for now. I know you were
            expecting a long explanation about each implementation I’ve made,
            but I’m learning as I go. I recently implemented a navigation bar
            that dynamically generates links to each file in my project folder,
            displaying them in a vertical menu for easy access to their
            respective pages. I also added an image to my website with custom
            dimensions to better fit the visual design.

          <h3>Semantic Markup</h3>
          <p>
            This is a fundamental part of the HTML language. Semantic markup is
            defined as the use of tags that convey meaning to the HTML document.
            It helps provide structure and context to the code, making it easier
            for others to read and understand. Semantic tags also guide search
            engines in interpreting the structure of a webpage, improving
            accessibility and SEO. It presents the content in an organized and
            meaningful way, which is important for both users and developers.
