          <h2>Lecture this week</h2>

          <p>
            This week's lecture touched base on the interactivity and interface
            design, it further extends on its definition of these two elements
            from the previous week. we spoke of the definition of interaction
            which is defined as a meeting point of an active body(Usually a
            user) and the variable it can affect and it came to be that an
            interface would be a symbolic representation of the meeting point
            that is described in the previous definition. "Interaction" was
            further explained and elaborated to have responsiveness that was
            non-random and effectively caused a change in a system internally.
            The concept of it as whole requires these key components, The
            user,The system itself (obviously), The element being manipulated,
            the action itself and the visual representation of the change the
            user caused. These combined perfectly elaborates the key elements
            looked for in interaction as a concept. But for it be meaningful, a
            visual representation is required in which an "Interface" would
            serve as the bridge for this interaction. In turn this would
            ultimately make us think how we would want our website to look and
            how we want the user to interact with the interface and website we
            tend to create. Which creates questions like "What is our target
            audience" ,"What are our goals" , "How do plan on mapping out our
            website or the structure of it" and so forth. My Website Goals and
            Alignment For my website, i wish to create a simple free flow
            website which is easy to navigate, i wish to create webpages that
            are direct and concise on how to move through the website in which
            any user can follow. Being an Engineering student a main component
            ive learned to grasp is being direct and to the point with this, i
            wish to emanate the same directness into my website. Although ive
            been programmed to be an engineer, i also aspire to improve artistic
            side, With this ..exploring CSS and javascript to make my website
            look more pleasing would be doing this but using an engineering
            approach. I would like my website to embody who i am and concisely
            elaborate on the work that ive done. my website in my eyes should be
            as close to An employed Web developer standard as i can. All in
            effort to display my coding and front end developing skills. My
            website is mostly target for the employers and people with in this
            profession, it will be illustrated as a portfolio website that
            displays the work i have throughout my degree with sections in game
            design, Web Development and Electronic projects. Truly depicting my
            capabilities and my overall potential in the workspace. I wish to
            create easy navigation and and easy to follow interface and
            interaction.

          <h3>My Website Progress</h3>

          <p>
            So far so good, that is what i can say so far, i know you were
            expecting some long explanation on each implementation i have but im
            learning as i go along, I recently implemented a navigation bar that
            dynamically generates links to each file in my project folder,
            displaying them in a vertical menu for easy access to their
            respective web pages as well as placed an image on my website with
            edited dimensions that i puzzled out to fit my website in a more
            aesthetic way.

          <h4>Semantic Mark up</h4>

          <p>
            This a fundamental part of the Html language, this defined as the
            marking tags that help convey meaning to a HTML program/ a document.
            it is something in which helps provide meaning and structure with in
            our code and to give context other readers of the document. It is a
            universal way of expressing Html as it provides a general style
            guide and understanding of the document being read. it also depicted
            as an easier way to read a document due to its structure and
            organised presentation of a web page. It also serves a purpose for
            search engines to understand the code and structure laid out.
