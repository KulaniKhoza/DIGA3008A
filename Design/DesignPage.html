          As we approach the fourth week of website development, we've been
          focusing on creating style guides and discussing which UI/UX elements
          to implement. Throughout these four weeks, our collective efforts have
          centered on mapping the desired visual appearance and user interaction
          patterns. My priority has been establishing a strong foundation for
          the website and learning my Html fundamentals. Ensuring my Website is
          user-friendly, easy to navigate, and aesthetically pleasing while
          effectively showcasing my capabilities, portfolio work, and overall
          course engagement.

          Header: This is where our primary source of navigation will be
          implemented, in which there will be labels/names listed horizontally,
          each representing a link to a webpage corresponding to the label/name.
          Along with this an Underline indicator will accompany the nav bar to
          show the user the current page they are on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Main: In the centre of our home page, This profile section will
          highlight a little bit of who I am, offering a brief description that
          presents me as both a professional and establishes me as a personal
          brand.This section is significant because it offers users
          (particularly future employers) insight into who I am before they
          explore my work. It creates a strong association between the website
          and my personal brand, effectively showcasing my capabilities.
          Surrounding my centered profile section will be floating, clickable
          images that serve as navigation to different website pages. Each image
          will visually represent its corresponding section.For example, the
          design icon will feature a wireframe illustration. Additionally, these
          icons will display dynamic content previews, such as the latest blog
          post or current project in my portfolio.

            Feedback: 
            <ul>
                <li>Alignment of clickable images needs to be fixed, the items seem to be too “floaty” , they should be inline with each other to look more standardised and professional</li>
                <li>The spacing and alignment of nav menu is not properly implemented therefore a calculation of spacing between links/labels is required. </li>
            </ul>
