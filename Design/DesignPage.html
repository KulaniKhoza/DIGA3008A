            As we approach the fourth week of website development, we've been
            focusing on creating style guides and discussing which UI/UX
            elements to implement. Throughout these four weeks, our collective
            efforts have centered on mapping the desired visual appearance and
            user interaction patterns. My priority has been establishing a
            strong foundation for the website and learning my Html fundamentals.
            Ensuring my Website is user-friendly, easy to navigate, and
            aesthetically pleasing while effectively showcasing my capabilities,
            portfolio work, and overall course engagement.

            Header: This is where our primary source of navigation will be
            implemented, in which there will be labels/names listed
            horizontally, each representing a link to a webpage corresponding to
            the label/name. Along with this an Underline indicator will
            accompany the nav bar to show the user the current page they are on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Main: In the centre of our home page, This profile section will
            highlight a little bit of who I am, offering a brief description
            that presents me as both a professional and establishes me as a
            personal brand.This section is significant because it offers users
            (particularly future employers) insight into who I am before they
            explore my work. It creates a strong association between the website
            and my personal brand, effectively showcasing my capabilities.
            Surrounding my centered profile section will be floating, clickable
            images that serve as navigation to different website pages. Each
            image will visually represent its corresponding section.For example,
            the design icon will feature a wireframe illustration. Additionally,
            these icons will display dynamic content previews, such as the
            latest blog post or current project in my portfolio.

            <li>
              Alignment of clickable images needs to be fixed, the items seem to
              be too “floaty” , they should be inline with each other to look
              more standardised and professional
            </li>
            <li>
              The spacing and alignment of nav menu is not properly implemented
              therefore a calculation of spacing between links/labels is
              required.

            This page displays each blog one after another with each blog being
            a rectangular icon,each describing a little bit about the blog. Each
            has a read more button on the corner of the icon for the user to
            click if they desire to see the whole blog in its entirety. Since
            there is a large number of blogs we are required to post, a scroll
            wheel will ensure the user can access each blog individually.

              The buttons on blog items are too much in the corner, it almost
              looks squashed therefore its advised that correct spacing is used.
            </li>
            <li>
              Navigation menu on wireframes should not change order, it should
              remain the same to avoid confusion for the user
