            <h2>Essay 1: UI/UX</h2>
            <p class="Content">
              Ethics of Interaction design encompasses laws and set guidelines
              that derive the best practices for UI/UX design, These stem from
              researched psychological factors and patterns emanated by humans
              to create user friendly interfaces that satisfy user needs without
              forms of manipulation.[1] These set principles and guidelines
              serve as the foundation to create enhanced usability and positive
              user engagement to help designers implement good user experience
              that satisfy the users needs and appeal to their intuitive
              essences.[1] Often called "Ethical Considerations," these
              principles acknowledge that implementing interface elements
              involves an iterative design process [2]. These principles are
              organized under three primary categories: Privacy and
              transparency, which focuses on safeguarding, protecting user data
              and providing clarity on certain things ; Inclusivity and
              Neutrality, which aims to eliminate bias and ensure accommodation
              for all demographic groups [3]; and Dark Patterns, which entails
              comparative analysis of manipulative design techniques that extend
              well beyond mere persuasion.
            </p>
            <p class="Content">
              With these primary categories and the general effectiveness of
              UI/UX elements,these are generally used to any website applicable.
              Hence in the context of these factors , the Capitec Bank website
              will be analysed and explored to show these ethical factors and
              the significance of the general UI/UX design as a whole.Capitec
              Bank operates as a national retail bank and financial services
              provider, offering both personal and business banking solutions.
              This South African institution is recognized for delivering
              affordable banking services, favorable interest rates on deposits
              and a user-friendly banking experience.[5]
            </p>
            <p class="Content">
              With this knowledge,privacy and transparency is repeatedly
              implemented throughout the website, the website initially requests
              cookie authorization, which functions as an encryption and
              security measure which serves as a first line of defense to
              protect user information and the first act to represent the
              privacy category. This practice aligns with global privacy laws
              designed to safeguard online user data.which is more so important
              for a banking website like capitec as a banking service company is
              expected to be secure due to the extensive amount of users of
              relying on the company on what some humans would say is their
              biggest asset “Money”. The sites continues to tighten its claim to
              strong data protection by add in a login element with a
              figure/link with an icon consisting of a key and a shield
              accompanied with sign in text on top right corner of the screen,
              these is element requires a username and password to access its
              benefits and asks only relevant information to keep user
              information private and to keep its professionalism to refrain
              from seeming like a scam.the Icon image emphasises its message as
              it appeals the users intuitive nature to associate with protection
              and safeguard hence the user will be more trusting and abiding to
              the UI element created.The login template reveals clear and
              readable questions that are kept at a minimal amount in effort to
              create more privacy and clarity to abide by the laws. Privacy laws
              of not only banking but of websites suggest that questions about a
              user that seem imposing should be kept at a minimum. This creates
              reliability and trust within the platform and alternatively helps
              the website adjust to the user only according to what he/she has
              chosen to reveal.
            </p>
            <p class="Content">
              Along with privacy, this website also evokes a sense of clarity
              and transparency in its interface elements, its free roaming
              clickable images show short descriptive paragraphs that entail
              what each topic is about, stating its purpose. The website also
              features realistic margin values in a blue undertone alongside an
              interactive calculator tool on the personal homepage, allowing
              users to visualize and calculate various financial scenarios. This
              transparency helps establish trust and clarity, as users can
              clearly see different potential outcomes through the website's
              honest presentation of financial data.Therefore making users
              create informed decisions based on their own needs and desires
              perfectly aligning with the ethical laws of ui/ux design.[2]
            </p>
            <p class="Content">
              Moving onto the next category of inclusivity and neutrality within
              the website. Capitec bank is mostly featured for a target audience
              within the working class which cuts a lot of demographic groups
              from being accommodated within its design. An example would be
              people under the age of 18 as their downright classified as people
              who aren't in need of bank accounts or any sort of financial
              service with in regards to what capitec offer. Despite this age
              restriction, the website fully accommodates the working-class
              demographic. Any working individual, regardless of educational
              background or language preference, can effectively navigate and
              interact with the website. The navigation bar features two main
              category sections: "Personal" and "Business". These categories are
              simplified and are understandable to any literate individual, this
              simple division helps avoid any financial lingo that may seem
              confusing for a user and accommodates for anyone to understand and
              ultimately aids the user through small straightforward step by
              step instructions to do what they desire. The Website also
              features language alternatives that help Demographics within South
              Africa that struggle with English, This provides an alternative
              method for users to interact with the website in their native
              language. This feature is particularly valuable for a nationwide
              business like Capitec, as South Africa has 11 official languages,
              ensuring the website accommodates Cultural diversity.Even with
              this, The site repetitively points to their call centres,
              displaying the number in large text for any more assistance for
              any user to utilize if any of these methods do not appeal
              effective to them. As human interaction appeals better to most
              users, as the issue presented by the user can be evaluated and
              adjusted for by the employee who is trained to do so. The only
              problem with this website in terms of inclusivity is their lack of
              implementation audio text to accommodate for the minority that are
              visually impaired, as through inspection no web audios have been
              recorded and or available on the site..
            </p>
            <p class="Content">
              Moving from inclusivity and touching on dark patterns and
              persuasion techniques. A dark pattern is known as a manipulative
              technique that makes a user perform an action that isn't their
              desired choice or of their best interest[2]. In context to the
              Capitec website, there is relatively no sign of any form of
              manipulation, every button links to where it’s intended to go and
              every link there is no misdemeanour of information that overvalued
              the product/service that is being provided by the company, The
              website is absent of any promotion, ad system and or phishing
              alerts system that would hence redirect the user to bombarded
              discounted/low-cost services/products to convince the user to
              click and evaluate these interface elements instead of doing what
              they intend on doing. The website also lacks ads that prevent
              users from interacting with the webpages as the many e-commerce
              web pages include Ad interface elements (e.g Image) that prevent
              the user from interacting with what they intend and instead moves
              the user to a different website entirely in effort to acquire
              financial profit/gain and to evolve another company's brand and
              marketing strategy. The website only evokes one seed of a possible
              grey area,this seed is evoked in the constant bombardment of
              prompts for a user to either “open an account” or “Switch to
              Capitec” on every page and or link on the website. All in an
              effort to persuade users to be loyal customers to their brand and
              essentially become frequent users to their product/service but
              then again this can also just be regarded as normal
              advertising/marketing.
            </p>
            <p class="Content">
              Evaluating the Capitec Bank website as a whole, the ethical laws
              and consideration going into UI/UX design has been implemented
              with full intention, touching base on ensuring that privacy and
              security is the main priority, maintaining inclusivity to a
              consistent degree to most demographic groups, ensuring that no
              manipulative techniques are implemented that could jeopardise the
              trust of the user and the association to the brand and keeping the
              users best interest at heart.With this,the general layout and
              UI/UX design of this website follows and perseus a professional
              standard. It follows a modern and clean look that is implemented
              in the workspace environment.its minimalist approach provides a
              user friendly interaction invoking intuitive navigation throughout
              the site. Its design avoids over stimulation and emphasises
              professional look which makes it ideal for a financial company
              where this is a top priority. The color palette and scheme
              emphasises its design as it remains consistent throughout the
              website and easy on the eyes. With the colours of the Capitec
              emblem serving its foundation and structure , reinforcing the
              company's brand identity. This strategic use of color ensures that
              the combination becomes strongly associated with Capitec, much
              like how customers instantly recognize yellow and red as
              representing McDonald's. Moving on to the content of the site,the
              text is very readable, with a well-structured hierarchy maintained
              throughout the website. The contrasting white background enhances
              the clarity of the text making both the font and colors stand out
              for easy readability. Titles are bolded with large fonts, while
              paragraphs feature a black san- serif style, legible text,
              ensuring an easy reading experience for a user. On top of that the
              site itself makes the readability an easier experience by ensuring
              that it is not bombarded by content-heavy paragraphs and topics.
              It includes only essential and relevant key points to keep the
              user engaged and able to understand hence making it more
              user-friendly. Despite this description there are a few grievances
              about this website that have some room for improvement, Although
              the navigation bar is straightforward, providing clear sections
              and headings for users to access banking information, it leads to
              different webpages that each have their own navigation bars. This
              inconsistency can be confusing. Additionally, the menu button
              feels somewhat hidden and may not be necessary. Instead,
              displaying the full navigation bar just like the main one and
              making all available sections and forums immediately visible would
              hence improve accessibility throughout the site.
            </p>
            <p class="Content">
              In Conclusion, the Capitec Bank website served its purpose and
              relayed a good experience, with Privacy and transparency fully
              implemented portraying a level of safety within the experience,
              Maintaining Inclusivity within the working class group to
              support,any and all groups within that demographic,Removing
              manipulation tactics to trick users to gain financial means and
              instead gain their trust and remain honest, to serve their best
              interest. All while maintaining a good UI/UX front and
              accommodating all these aspects while looking aesthetically simple
              and clean. A website can never be described as perfect as we all
              share different views on what that is but this experience was more
              than good to say the least.
