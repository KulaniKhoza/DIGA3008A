            <h2>Essay 1: UI/UX</h2>
            <p class="Content">
              Ethics of Interaction design encompasses laws and set guidelines
              that derive the best practices for UI/UX design, These stem from
              researched psychological factors and patterns emanated by humans
              to create user friendly interfaces that satisfy user needs without
              forms of manipulation.[1] These set principles and guidelines
              serve as the foundation to create enhanced usability and positive
              user engagement to help designers implement good user experience
              that satisfy the users needs and appeal to their intuitive
              essences.[1] Often called "Ethical Considerations," these
              principles acknowledge that implementing interface elements
              involves an iterative design process [2]. These principles are
              organized under three primary categories: Privacy and
              transparency, which focuses on safeguarding, protecting user data
              and providing clarity on certain things ; Inclusivity and
              Neutrality, which aims to eliminate bias and ensure accommodation
              for all demographic groups [3]; and Dark Patterns, which entails
              comparative analysis of manipulative design techniques that extend
              well beyond mere persuasion.
            </p>
            <p class="Content">
              With these primary categories and the general effectiveness of
              UI/UX elements,these are generally used to any website applicable.
              Hence in the context of these factors , the Capitec Bank website
              will be analysed and explored to show these ethical factors and
              the significance of the general UI/UX design as a whole.Capitec
              Bank operates as a national retail bank and financial services
              provider, offering both personal and business banking solutions.
              This South African institution is recognized for delivering
              affordable banking services, favorable interest rates on deposits
              and a user-friendly banking experience.[5]
            </p>
            <p class="Content">
              With this knowledge,privacy and transparency is repeatedly
              implemented throughout the website, the website initially requests
              cookie authorization, which functions as an encryption and
              security measure which serves as a first line of defense to
              protect user information and the first act to represent the
              privacy category. This practice aligns with global privacy laws
              designed to safeguard online user data.which is more so important
              for a banking website like capitec as a banking service company is
              expected to be secure due to the extensive amount of users of
              relying on the company on what some humans would say is their
              biggest asset “Money”. The sites continues to tighten its claim to
              strong data protection by add in a login element with a
              figure/link with an icon consisting of a key and a shield
              accompanied with sign in text on top right corner of the screen,
              these is element requires a username and password to access its
              benefits and asks only relevant information to keep user
              information private and to keep its professionalism to refrain
              from seeming like a scam.the Icon image emphasises its message as
              it appeals the users intuitive nature to associate with protection
              and safeguard hence the user will be more trusting and abiding to
              the UI element created.The login template reveals clear and
              readable questions that are kept at a minimal amount in effort to
              create more privacy and clarity to abide by the laws. Privacy laws
              of not only banking but of websites suggest that questions about a
              user that seem imposing should be kept at a minimum. This creates
              reliability and trust within the platform and alternatively helps
              the website adjust to the user only according to what he/she has
              chosen to reveal.
            </p>
            <p class="Content">
              Along with privacy, this website also evokes a sense of clarity
              and transparency in its interface elements, its free roaming
              clickable images show short descriptive paragraphs that entail
              what each topic is about, stating its purpose. The website also
              features realistic margin values in a blue undertone alongside an
              interactive calculator tool on the personal homepage, allowing
              users to visualize and calculate various financial scenarios. This
              transparency helps establish trust and clarity, as users can
              clearly see different potential outcomes through the website's
              honest presentation of financial data.Therefore making users
              create informed decisions based on their own needs and desires
              perfectly aligning with the ethical laws of ui/ux design.[2]
            </p>
            <p class="Content">
              Moving onto the next category of inclusivity and neutrality within
              the website. Capitec bank is mostly featured for a target audience
              within the working class which cuts a lot of demographic groups
              from being accommodated within its design. An example would be
              people under the age of 18 as their downright classified as people
              who aren't in need of bank accounts or any sort of financial
              service with in regards to what capitec offer. Despite this age
              restriction, the website fully accommodates the working-class
              demographic. Any working individual, regardless of educational
              background or language preference, can effectively navigate and
              interact with the website. The navigation bar features two main
              category sections: "Personal" and "Business". These categories are
              simplified and are understandable to any literate individual, this
              simple division helps avoid any financial lingo that may seem
              confusing for a user and accommodates for anyone to understand and
              ultimately aids the user through small straightforward step by
              step instructions to do what they desire. The Website also
              features language alternatives that help Demographics within South
              Africa that struggle with English, This provides an alternative
              method for users to interact with the website in their native
              language. This feature is particularly valuable for a nationwide
              business like Capitec, as South Africa has 11 official languages,
              ensuring the website accommodates Cultural diversity.Even with
              this, The site repetitively points to their call centres,
              displaying the number in large text for any more assistance for
              any user to utilize if any of these methods do not appeal
              effective to them. As human interaction appeals better to most
              users, as the issue presented by the user can be evaluated and
              adjusted for by the employee who is trained to do so. The only
              problem with this website in terms of inclusivity is their lack of
              implementation audio text to accommodate for the minority that are
              visually impaired, as through inspection no web audios have been
              recorded and or available on the site..
            </p>
            <p class="Content">
              Moving from inclusivity and touching on dark patterns and
              persuasion techniques. A dark pattern is known as a manipulative
              technique that makes a user perform an action that isn't their
              desired choice or of their best interest[2]. In context to the
              Capitec website, there is relatively no sign of any form of
              manipulation, every button links to where it’s intended to go and
              every link there is no misdemeanour of information that overvalued
              the product/service that is being provided by the company, The
              website is absent of any promotion, ad system and or phishing
              alerts system that would hence redirect the user to bombarded
              discounted/low-cost services/products to convince the user to
              click and evaluate these interface elements instead of doing what
              they intend on doing. The website also lacks ads that prevent
              users from interacting with the webpages as the many e-commerce
              web pages include Ad interface elements (e.g Image) that prevent
              the user from interacting with what they intend and instead moves
              the user to a different website entirely in effort to acquire
              financial profit/gain and to evolve another company's brand and
              marketing strategy. The website only evokes one seed of a possible
              grey area,this seed is evoked in the constant bombardment of
              prompts for a user to either “open an account” or “Switch to
              Capitec” on every page and or link on the website. All in an
              effort to persuade users to be loyal customers to their brand and
              essentially become frequent users to their product/service but
              then again this can also just be regarded as normal
              advertising/marketing.
            </p>
            <p class="Content">
              Evaluating the Capitec Bank website as a whole, the ethical laws
              and consideration going into UI/UX design has been implemented
              with full intention, touching base on ensuring that privacy and
              security is the main priority, maintaining inclusivity to a
              consistent degree to most demographic groups, ensuring that no
              manipulative techniques are implemented that could jeopardise the
              trust of the user and the association to the brand and keeping the
              users best interest at heart.With this,the general layout and
              UI/UX design of this website follows and perseus a professional
              standard. It follows a modern and clean look that is implemented
              in the workspace environment.its minimalist approach provides a
              user friendly interaction invoking intuitive navigation throughout
              the site. Its design avoids over stimulation and emphasises
              professional look which makes it ideal for a financial company
              where this is a top priority. The color palette and scheme
              emphasises its design as it remains consistent throughout the
              website and easy on the eyes. With the colours of the Capitec
              emblem serving its foundation and structure , reinforcing the
              company's brand identity. This strategic use of color ensures that
              the combination becomes strongly associated with Capitec, much
              like how customers instantly recognize yellow and red as
              representing McDonald's. Moving on to the content of the site,the
              text is very readable, with a well-structured hierarchy maintained
              throughout the website. The contrasting white background enhances
              the clarity of the text making both the font and colors stand out
              for easy readability. Titles are bolded with large fonts, while
              paragraphs feature a black san- serif style, legible text,
              ensuring an easy reading experience for a user. On top of that the
              site itself makes the readability an easier experience by ensuring
              that it is not bombarded by content-heavy paragraphs and topics.
              It includes only essential and relevant key points to keep the
              user engaged and able to understand hence making it more
              user-friendly. Despite this description there are a few grievances
              about this website that have some room for improvement, Although
              the navigation bar is straightforward, providing clear sections
              and headings for users to access banking information, it leads to
              different webpages that each have their own navigation bars. This
              inconsistency can be confusing. Additionally, the menu button
              feels somewhat hidden and may not be necessary. Instead,
              displaying the full navigation bar just like the main one and
              making all available sections and forums immediately visible would
              hence improve accessibility throughout the site.
            </p>
            <p class="Content">
              In Conclusion, the Capitec Bank website served its purpose and
              relayed a good experience, with Privacy and transparency fully
              implemented portraying a level of safety within the experience,
              Maintaining Inclusivity within the working class group to
              support,any and all groups within that demographic,Removing
              manipulation tactics to trick users to gain financial means and
              instead gain their trust and remain honest, to serve their best
              interest. All while maintaining a good UI/UX front and
              accommodating all these aspects while looking aesthetically simple
              and clean. A website can never be described as perfect as we all
              share different views on what that is but this experience was more
              than good to say the least.

            <h2>Reflection of Website Implementation</h2>
            <p class="Content">
              The implementation of a website is deeply influenced by its user
              interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design. A well-structured
              codebase not only brings the design to life but also ensures
              performance, accessibility, and maintainability. In developing my
              website, I carefully considered how each technical decision would
              support both the visual design and the user journey. This essay
              explores how UI/UX considerations shaped my implementation,
              covering folder structure, semantic markup, metadata, CSS, and
              JavaScript. By aligning code architecture with design principles,
              I created a seamless experience for users while ensuring the site
              remains scalable and easy to maintain.

              Folder Structure: Organizing for an easier read
            </h3>
            <p class="Content">
              A logical folder structure was essential for maintaining a clean
              and scalable codebase. I organized my files hierarchically to
              reflect the website’s content flow while separating concerns into
              distinct layers.The main Directory folder, DIGA3008A, is
              well-organized with dedicated subdirectories for project assets
              for the such as images, PDFs, portfolio pieces, blog posts,
              essays, and a design section that includes fonts and icons,making
              all resources easy to locate and manage throughout the designing
              process. Each web page has its own subdirectory, containing a
              specific HTML file along(expect the index.html representing the
              homepage) with page-specific stylesheets excluding some sections
              that only require the global style sheet.Some directories contain
              multiple HTML files for instance, the Blogs subdirectory includes
              several individual blog post files, with each one representing a
              separate weekly entry. Styles are systematically divided into
              folders for global styles, reusable components, and responsive
              layouts, allowing each page to load only the styles it requires.
              While most pages have dedicated stylesheets tailored to their
              content, some simpler sections rely solely on shared or global
              styles. The “Style.css” file serves as the core stylesheet,
              maintaining visual consistency and providing foundational styling
              across the entire site.This modular approach promotes cleaner
              code, easier maintenance, and better scalability.JavaScript
              modules are grouped by functionality in the “Scripts” folder, such
              as “Scripts.js” for menu interactions,button interactions and
              general foundational functionality ; An APIs.js file is used for
              data fetching and asynchronous functions, providing shared
              functionality across the website for the specific pages where the
              script is applied. This modular approach allows for focused
              updates without affecting unrelated features. Additionally, I
              adopted consistent naming conventions (e.g.,
              “{Filename}Homepage.html”, “{Filename}.css”) to improve
              readability and make the codebase more intuitive for future
              collaborators.Admittedly, some naming conventions deviate from
              standard practices. For example, homepages are typically labeled
              as “index.html”, which I intend to correct in future iterations.
              Similarly, the weekly blog posts are currently named “Blog1”,
              “Blog2”, “Blog3”, etc., which doesn’t clearly reflect their
              identity as part of a blog series. A more descriptive and
              consistent naming structure will enhance clarity and
              maintainability moving forward(possibly week1,week2 and etc).

              Semantic Markup: Building an Accessible Foundation
            </h3>
            <p class="Content">
              Semantic HTML5 elements formed the backbone of my website’s
              structure, enhancing both accessibility and SEO. Instead of the
              generic div containers that have scoured the internet and the tech
              industry, I promoted the use of meaningful tags like header, nav,
              section, main and article to provide clear context for screen
              readers and search engines.I only used the div tag when absolutely
              necessary typically for layout or grouping elements that didn’t
              fit a specific semantic role. For example, the main
              navigation(navbar) uses a nav element with class names
              complementing its links as well as descriptive Aria labels,
              Information and paragraphs are wrapped in section tags with
              relevant headings. Interactive elements, such as buttons and
              icons, include descriptive labels and allow keyboard navigation. I
              also implemented a proper heading hierarchy (h1 for page titles,
              h2for section headings, etc.) to create a logical document
              outline. These choices not only improved accessibility but also
              made the code easier to debug and style, as each element’s purpose
              was self-evident.Admittedly, I often put normal p tags to be
              wrapped in nested section and article as interchangeable, which
              led to my documents being filled with nested sections and tags
              that some may have followed an incorrect hierarchy and
              definition,something I now recognize as bad practice. Overall, my
              semantic markup is fairly basic, with definite room for
              improvement. I’m learning that changing it later is more
              challenging than expected, especially since it forms the
              foundation of my work. Because of this, I had to come up with a
              clear class naming system to accommodate different styles and
              avoid confusion as the project grew.

              Metadata: Enhancing Discovery and Consistency
            </h3>
            <p class="Content">
              I initially underestimated the importance of metadata, treating it
              more like a formality than a meaningful part of web development. I
              included only the basic viewport tags and simple, generic
              descriptions, things like “author” and “description”. I used these
              basic conventions without fully understanding how metadata shapes
              visibility in search engines and how content is previewed on
              social media. I didn’t realize I was missing out until I compared
              my work to competitors whose pages had rich fragments, eye
              catching previews, and stronger engagement. That realization
              changed how I approach metadata. I now see it as a strategic tool
              rather than an afterthought. Unfortunately it was a bit late , I
              now wish to focus on crafting unique meta descriptions, using
              structured data for enhanced search listings, and optimizing
              social tags like twitter and instagram tags to create better
              searchability. These elements silently but powerfully influence
              how users and platforms interpret and rank content. This
              experience and my marks(Unfortanely *ha ha) taught me that
              metadata is not just technical overhead it’s an invisible layer of
              design that helps connect content to its audience and shapes its
              first impression across the digital landscape

              CSS: Styling with Purpose and Consistency
            </h3>
            <p class="Content">
              My CSS architecture prioritized consistency and adaptability
              across devices. I adopted using flexible grids,flexboxes and media
              queries to ensure the layout scaled smoothly for desktop and
              mobiles. Global styles, such as color variables and
              headings,paragraphs and navigations were defined in a Style.css
              file, making it easy to update the site’s theme.I tried to follow
              semantic naming conventions to keep my styles modular and avoid
              naming conflicts. However, because I wanted each page to have a
              distinct design, many elements had to be specifically targeted.
              This led to a large CSS file filled with numerous custom class
              names. For example, a button component might use the class
              “.navbuttons”, while a variant like “view project” would have its
              own unique class. Similarly, a card component might be styled
              using .content-card for its child elements. This approach taught
              me the tediousness of css if semantic mark up is not applied
              properly and the need of Good class/id naming conventions.
              Although this was the case for some elements this gave me
              flexibility in design, but at the cost of scalability and
              simplicity which was all the more worth it. I avoided inline
              styles entirely, relying instead on external stylesheets for
              better caching and maintainability. This systematic approach
              ensured that the UI remained visually cohesive while being easy to
              tweak during design iterations.

              JavaScript: Enhancing Interactivity and Functionality
            </h3>
            <p class="Content">
              JavaScript brought interactivity to my website while maintaining
              performance and usability. I structured my scripts into reusable
              modules, such as a Script.js for input checking(DOM) and for menu
              functionalities, to avoid code duplication, other scripts were
              specifically named to let observers know each implementation along
              with its method without confusion .Event delegation was heavily
              utilized, particularly with semantic elements like buttons, using
              “onclick” functions. For example, a single event listener attached
              to the document was responsible for handling clicks on dynamically
              generated buttons, which improved performance and made the code
              more maintainable. API requests were handled asynchronously using
              the Fetch API, enabling efficient data retrieval without freezing
              the page. This was mainly implemented in the portfolio section,
              where a GitHub API was used to fetch repository information. I
              also included loading and error handling to enhance user
              experience buttons displayed loading text when clicked, and
              appropriate feedback was provided during data fetching. To
              optimize performance even more, I used lazy loading for images
              below the fold. These techniques ensured that interactions felt
              instantaneous while keeping page load times fast, directly
              enhancing the UX.

            <h3 class="essaysubheading">Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="Content">
              The UI/UX design strongly shaped my website’s technical
              foundation. From organized folders to responsive layouts and
              semantic HTML, each choice balanced user experience with
              maintainability. Efficient JavaScript and thoughtful metadata
              enhanced performance and visibility. This alignment between design

            <h2>Essay 2: Digital Colonialism,geopolitics & the internet</h2>
            <p class="Content">
              With the rise and advancement of digital technologies and the tech
              industry as a whole. From things Artificial intelligence (AI) and
              big data analytics and Social media platforms. The Internet has
              transformed economies, societies, and daily life. Yet, these
              innovations have not been distributed equally. Instead, they often
              reinforce and allude to existing social inequalities, creating
              what Lutz refers to as digital divides[1]. These digital divides
              form a framework for understanding the concept of “digital
              colonialism.”Providing on how digital inequalities constitute gaps
              in access and general power that are coherently controlled by big
              tech companies. This term “digital colonialism” refers to the
              exercise of imperial power over large populations through systems
              of rules, designs, languages, cultures, and beliefs that serve
              dominant interests, allowing control over essential digital
              infrastructures and data.[2]This paper uses Christoph Lutz’s
              (2019) article, "Digital Inequalities in the Age of Artificial
              Intelligence and Big Data," to systematically examine these
              divides through a three-level framework: disparities in access
              (first-level), skills and usage (second-level), and outcomes
              (third-level)[1].To compare and evaluate the relationship between
              digital colonialism and digital divides, while also examining
              their impact on the tech industry, global society, and how they
              influence geopolitical decisions;supported by relevant examples.

            <p class="Content">
              Lutz begins his discussion with evaluating evolution of digital
              inequalities research, structured around three levels of the
              digital divide, the first being an inequality of access in the
              digital space/industry. This highlights that "access" goes beyond
              its traditional meaning,it is not merely about the gap between
              those who have and those who lack information technology[1], but
              also refers to the quality, control, and agency users have over
              that technology. As digital standards evolve, so do expectations
              around equitable access. Lutz contextualizes this through the
              example of mobile internet access, noting that in many countries,
              mobile connectivity is the most common form of access. While this
              is certainly better than having no access at all, it still
              represents a significant digital divide. Mobile internet is often
              slower, less reliable, and offers limited content availability[1],
              unfairly affecting users in low-income and developing regions.This
              highlights the geographical inequalities that persist in the
              digital age[2], where the quality of access,not just its presence
              shapes participation, opportunity, and even digital literacy,
              emphasizing that mere internet availability is not enough. The
              geographical divide presents itself between nations that control
              digital tech industries and those who rely on foreign technology
              corporations for basic connectivity and access. This creates a
              form of digital dependency , where developing regions remain
              consumers rather than equal participants in the digital economy
              and be at the mercy of the big tech companies .
            </p>
            <p class="Content">
              The second digital divide that Lutz article extends as a form of
              digital inequality, it expresses the disparity in digital skills
              and literacy.This builds on the first digital divide, which
              focuses on the quality of access, but the second digital divide
              goes further by highlighting the ability to use digital tools
              effectively. He alludes that while many are able to use the
              internet for generic research ,searching and scour social media
              platforms for entertainment purposes and communication, they are
              unable to utilize its capabilities into skills that matter and
              provide value in the digital economy. This gap often exists
              because users in disadvantaged regions, usually in developing
              countries,frequently lack the contextual knowledge or digital
              literacy needed to use technology effectively. This challenge is
              compounded by the algorithmic control exerted by major tech
              companies, which can manipulate the data and content users intake.
              These algorithms shape what people learn, think, and believe
              online, giving powerful companies control over digital spaces.This
              is a form of digital colonialism, where powerful countries and
              tech companies stay in control by limiting others’ access to
              information. They shape online content to promote their own
              interests, giving their citizens an advantage while keeping less
              powerful groups at a disadvantage. A good example is the article
              comparing Chinese and American TikTok algorithms, showing how
              content is tailored differently in each region to push specific
              values or ideas[3]. A google employee for ethical tech use,
              compared China's approach to TikTok saying that China's
              algorithm,focused on education, science and things of good use in
              the digital economy while they shared addictive and “opium”
              versions of content for other countries except their own[3]. In
              China, children under 14 are shown educational content such as
              science experiments and educational videos and their usage is
              capped at 40 minutes per day[3]. This reflects how technology can
              be intentionally designed to shape youth development and national
              values. Compared to the American version of the algorithm, it
              promotes more entertainment-focused and often addictive content,
              with far fewer restrictions on the youth. This sparks disparity
              conversations on the powerful role of geographic and political
              choices in shaping digital experiences and narratives sparking
              more social and cultural change . This hence shows how technology
              can promote nation interests and spark subtle digital colonialism
              into other nations along with reinforcing specific cultural values
              and behaviors showing that the internet is not a neutral tool.

            <p class="Content">
              The third digital divide that Lutz expresses is embedded in
              exposing and alluding to systemic constraints and unfair biased
              outcomes. This is a contrasting relationship between the second
              and third divide. The second digital divide focuses on disparities
              in skills and meaningful usage, the third digital divide shifts
              attention to inequitable outcomes. Simply put, the second digital
              divide is about having the skills and The third is about whether
              the system treats you fairly and lets you succeed, even if you
              have the skills and access.These structural barriers often prevent
              marginalised groups like this from translating digital engagement
              into economic, social, or political gains. One of the root causes
              stems from the systemic power of digital platforms to shape
              narratives and exploit user data. This involves the large-scale
              collection and analysis of personal data through algorithms and
              privacy regulations. Platforms use this data(digital footprint
              including browsing history, location etc)to train models that
              personalize content. These algorithmic processes can reinforce
              existing biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes in areas like
              job advertising and content exposure. This demonstrates how data
              exploitation and lack of algorithmic transparency contribute to
              the third digital divide.This type of control also impacts the
              socio-economic environment. Marginalized groups, who are more
              vulnerable to mass data exploitation, are disproportionately
              affected. They are more likely to be targeted with misleading
              information, manipulated by algorithmic biases, and more prone to
              discrimination. This reinforces existing inequalities and shows
              another way digital colonialism can be pushed . This can lead to
              digital exclusion,not just in access, but in the quality and
              fairness of online experiences.

              having read this article, real life examples can be analysed and
              exposed. A recent example occurred in February 2025, when Google
              Maps renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the "Gulf of America" for
              U.S.-based users[4]. President Donald Trump in his first day in
              office initialised this command as an executive order to federally
              obtain and overturn its economic and cultural significance to
              America's national economy[5]. To provide some context: a gulf
              ,defined by the United Nations ,is an inland sea that extends
              across a country’s borders[6]. The so-called "Gulf of America"
              lies in close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, which raises
              concerns about who owns the territory and brings potential
              justifications for the inland claims.The "Gulf of America"
              incident exemplifies how digital platforms exercise colonial power
              by unilaterally reshaping geopolitical narratives through
              algorithmic control and data-driven power. This renaming order
              disregards the extensive period of the established usage of the
              name and the water body's significance to multiple nations' and
              its cultural identity. It demonstrates digital colonialism in
              action, as tech corporations now assert authority over geographic
              representation much like colonial powers used to take over
              specific lands they desired. This controversy reveals how platform
              algorithms and imperial powers exert dominant geopolitical views.
              This sidelines local and historical claims, creating modern power
              imbalances where those who control digital platforms can erase or
              change not just territory identities but cultural ones as well
              which further shows the disparity in power in the geopolitical
              space.

            <p class="Content">
              In conclusion, the relationship between digital divides and
              digital colonialism reveals a deeply rooted imbalance in how
              digital technologies are accessed, used, and experienced globally.
              Christoph Lutz’s three-level framework offers a lens to evaluate
              these inequities;from disparities in access and digital literacy
              to biased outcomes shaped by systemic structures. As demonstrated
              through real-world examples like TikTok’s algorithmic control and
              the controversial renaming of the Gulf of Mexico, digital
              platforms not only reflect but actively reinforce global power
              disparities and imbalances. These platforms have evolved into
              modern instruments of influence that are able to change the shape
              of cultural, economic, and geopolitical narratives. The term
              “digital colonialism” captures this reality where control over
              data, algorithms, and digital infrastructures enables dominant
              entities to impose their values and interests to disadvantage
              others.
